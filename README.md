# readme-generator

## Description
This project was fiun and a bit complicated at first. However, once I was able to get the first parts working I instantly knew what to do after. My motivation was seeing it working. Therefore, this pushed me to complete the tasks.

The difficult part for me was installing the badges but I think I managed or I did the wrong thing. However, I was happy with how it turned out and the layout looks great!
